# 🔁 Workflow Summary
🎤 Record speech input → input_capture.py
📝 Convert to text → SpeechRecognition / Whisper
🔎 Vector search using Qdrant → vector_search.py
🧠 Create final prompt → prompt_builder.py
📡 Send request to GPT4 via curl → gpt_request.py
🔊 Convert response to speech → text_to_speech.py
🔁 Loop back for next round


Next Steps:

1. # Intelligent Listening & Stop Detection(Voice Activity Detection)
-> Libraries like webrtcvad can help in identifying speech segments
-> speech_recognition: Python library for performing speech recognition.​

2. # Custom Voice Cloning (Your Voice or a Friend’s)
To train the voice bot to use your voice or a friend's:
# Coqui TTS: 
An open-source TTS library that allows you to train custom voices using your own data. It supports multilingual synthesis and fine-tuning existing models. 
# OpenVoice v2: 
Developed by MyShell.ai, this model can replicate a speaker's voice from a short audio clip and supports speech generation in multiple languages.
# Real-Time Voice Cloning:
A deep learning framework that enables cloning voices with just a few seconds of audio.

Steps to Train a Custom Voice:
Data Collection: Record high-quality audio samples (at least 30 minutes) of the target voice.​
Preprocessing: Clean and segment the audio files, and prepare corresponding transcripts.​
Model Training: Use tools like Coqui TTS to train the model on your da
Integration: Incorporate the trained model into your voice bot system.


# 3. Multilingual Understanding & Response
Whisper by OpenAI: A multilingual speech recognition model that can transcribe audio in various languages.​



✅ Your Goal
🧠 Real-time, multilingual AI voice bot
🎤 Understands and speaks fluently in the customer’s language
💸 Gently but effectively persuades the user to repay or acknowledge dues

🧱 Recommended Real-Time Voice Bot Architecture
# 🎙️ 1. Speech-to-Text (Multilingual ASR)
Use OpenAI Whisper (tiny or medium models for speed).
🌍 Detects and transcribes 99+ languages.
🧠 Automatically identifies the spoken language.
🛠 Use in real-time via:
faster-whisper
whisper-live with VAD
whisper-ctranslate2 for fast GPU/CPU inference

# 🌐 2. Language-Aware Memory + Prompting
Once you get the transcription:
Detect the language using langdetect
Retrieve memory (Qdrant) based on person ID
Build a prompt like:
Language: Hindi
User Info: ...
Conversation History: ...
User: मैं भुगतान नहीं कर सकता
Assistant:
Send to multilingual LLM like GPT-4 or DeepSeek-MoE (Open Source)

# 💬 3. LLM (Multilingual)
Use an LLM that:
Supports multilingual conversation
Can be instructed with tone ("empathetic", "persuasive")

Options:
Model	Supports	Hosting
GPT-4	All major languages	API
Gemma, Mistral, Mixtral	Multi-lingual	Local via ollama
DeepSeek-MoE	Very strong in reasoning + multilingual	Fast + Open source

# 🔊 4. Text-to-Speech (TTS) in Same Language
After GPT generates the response:
Detect the language again (or reuse)
Use a multilingual TTS model
Best Open Source Options:
Tool	        Voice Training?	Language Support	Notes
Coqui TTS	    ✅ Yes (custom voice cloning)	🌍 1000+	Best overall
OpenVoice v2	✅ Few-shot cloning	🌍 30+	Fast + realistic
Real-Time Voice Cloning	✅ Yes	Limited	Needs more data
✅ Use lang → voice_id mapping to pick the right voice for each language.

# 🧠 5. Memory Storage (Vector DB)
Store every spoken word + assistant reply in Qdrant:
type: chat
language: hi / en / ta etc.
Timestamp, role, person_id
# ✅ Add Smart Flow Control
Voice Activity Detection (webrtcvad) to avoid speaking over user
Wake word ("hello bot") optional for listening
Interrupt TTS if user starts speaking

# 💸 Nudging for Payments
Use fine-tuned prompts:
“Be polite but assertive”
“Offer helpful options like EMI or minimum payment”
Example system prompt:
You are a friendly recovery assistant. Always sound helpful, not robotic. Suggest options like minimum payment, due dates, and EMI plans. Speak in user's language.

# 🧠 Bonus: Collect Data for Insights
Log speech + GPT response
Track which prompts lead to successful payments
Improve prompts and memory personalization over time

✅ You’ll Need:
Component	        Tool
ASR	    whisper, faster-whisper
TTS	    Coqui TTS, OpenVoice, Edge TTS
LLM	    GPT-4, DeepSeek-MoE, Gemma
Memory	Qdrant
Audio	pyaudio, sounddevice, ffmpeg
Language langdetect, fasttext

Ready-to-Go Stack:
🎙️ faster-whisper → STT
🧠 Qdrant → retrieve info
🗣️ GPT-4 or DeepSeek-MoE → reply
🔊 Coqui TTS → speak reply
🧾 Save memory (person_id, text, lang, role, type, timestamp)



user speaks-> Intelligent Listening & Stop Detection using webrtcvad -> Whisper (language detect) + Transcript -> Qdrant vector db search and retrive past calls -> Enhanced Prompt in the user language with user info + past 10 interactions to LLM GPT-4 -> LLM Response text in short (20 words) -> Text to speech (Coqui TTS) in parallel the generated script stored in vector db -> BOT responds.
